## Opening an issue

<br>
Thank you for taking the time to open an issue.
Before opening an issue, please be sure that your issue hasn't already been asked by someone

Here are a few things that will help me help resolve your issues:

- A descriptive title that gives an idea of what your issue refers to
- A thorough description of the issue, (one word descriptions are very hard to understand)
- Screenshots (if appropriate)
- Links (if appropriate)
